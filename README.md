# Medical Image Analysis with GPT-4 Vision

This Streamlit web application leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model to analyze medical images and provide detailed insights. It offers users the ability to upload medical images and receive expert-like analysis, along with an option for simplified explanations. Features include uploading and analyzing medical images, receiving detailed analysis simulating a medical expert's perspective, an option for simplified explanations (ELI5 - Explain Like I'm 5) of the analysis results, and a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit. The app uses Streamlit for the web interface, OpenAI API (GPT-4 Vision for image analysis and GPT-3.5-Turbo for simplified explanations), and Python as the core programming language. To install, clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-image-analysis.git), navigate to the directory (cd medical-image-analysis), install required packages (pip install -r requirements.txt), and set up environment variables by creating a .env file with your OpenAI API key (OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here). To use, run the Streamlit app (streamlit run app.py), open the provided local URL in your web browser, upload a medical image, click 'Analyze Image' to get the analysis, and optionally select 'ELI5' for a simplified explanation. Important note: This application is for educational and demonstration purposes only. Always consult with a qualified medical professional before making any health-related decisions. Limitations include the accuracy depending on image quality and model capabilities, and the app not storing previous analyses. Future improvements may include user authentication, support for multiple image uploads, and integration with medical databases. Contributions to improve the application are welcome.
